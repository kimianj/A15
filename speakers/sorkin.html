		<h2>Movie Reviews</h2>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Lots of heat but very mich light."  It came across as a kind of daytime soap opera version 
			shwoing the personalities of the player rather then dealng with the nuts and bolts of
			what really happened.  Even that would not have been so sad, but the movie tries to portrary
			lots of there folks as sympathetic figures just trying to do the right thing"

	</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"I am watching this for the 3rd time, trying to understand how this large group of captialists pigs could lotality screw
			their families, descendtants, neightbors, countrymen and the rest of the whole with absolutly no compassion"
